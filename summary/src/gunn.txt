Two people spotted sleeping in a truck last week are facing charges after it was determined the truck had been stolen in Lac Ste. Anne County in November, police said. Parkland RCMP and the Crime Reduction Unit were patrolling Gunn on Jan. 26 on the lookout for property crimes and repeat offenders, according to RCMP. They came across the Ford pickup truck, which police said had no licence plate. “Officers arrested the two occupants; both suspects are known to police,” Parkland RCMP stated. Kevin Daniel Stolth, 43, of Gunn was arrested, having five outstanding warrants from Whitecourt, Fort Saskatchewan and Stony Plain, police said. Stolth is now facing additional charges of possessing illegally obtained property worth over $5,000 and failure to comply with release conditions. Tanya Nichol Westoby, 44, was also arrested on five warrants, from Stony Plain and Edmonton. She was charged with possessing illegally obtained property worth over $5,000 and breaching probation. Police said Stolth is in custody and will go to the Alberta Court of Justice in Stony Plain on Feb. 5. Meanwhile, Westoby was released and is scheduled to go to the Stony Plain court on Feb. 21.
