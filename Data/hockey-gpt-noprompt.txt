Saiker’s Acres once again became a hub of activity as it hosted the World’s Longest Hockey Game Juniors in support of the Cure Cancer Foundation from January 25th at 3 p.m. until January 28th at 6 p.m. Brent Saik, the organizer of the event, humorously remarked, "Final score? Cure always wins." The teams, named 'Hope' and 'Team Cure', symbolized the ongoing battle against cancer, with all proceeds supporting pediatric clinical trials through the University of Alberta.

A total of 45 youth players, aged 10 to 16, participated in this unforgettable game. The event saw the presence of Oilers alumni Craig MacTavish and Kevin Lowe, who kicked off the game with a ceremonial puck drop on Thursday. Lowe emphasized how cancer impacts everyone and praised the community's unity in fighting against it.

One standout player, Xavier Wujcik, showcased remarkable endurance by playing seven three-hour shifts and scoring 140 goals. Despite feeling fatigued towards the end, he expressed his gratitude for being part of such a meaningful cause. Other young players like Landon Ternovatsky and Kane Reimer also shared personal connections to cancer and were proud to contribute to cancer research.

By the end of the event, an impressive 2,299 goals were scored, and over $400,000 was raised. Brent Saik commended the children's efforts, highlighting their ability to rally support from friends, family, and even strangers. The success of the event mirrored the passion seen in the inaugural Kids World’s Longest Hockey Game in March 2023, indicating a sustained commitment to the cause.

Saik's son, Jesse, echoed the sentiment of saving lives through fundraising efforts. Since its inception in 2003, the World’s Longest Hockey Game at Saiker’s Acres has raised over $7.4 million for cancer research, showcasing the enduring impact of community-driven initiatives.

Looking ahead, preparations are underway for Saiker’s Acres to host the World’s Longest Baseball Game in September, while the adult version of the World’s Longest Hockey Game is scheduled to return in February 2025. Brent Saik, ever the dedicated organizer, humorously remarked about needing to start training for the next event immediately.
