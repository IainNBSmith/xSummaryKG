Two individuals found sleeping in a truck last week are now facing charges after authorities discovered the truck had been stolen in Lac Ste. Anne County back in November. Parkland RCMP and the Crime Reduction Unit were conducting patrols in Gunn on January 26 when they encountered the Ford pickup truck, which lacked a license plate. The occupants, identified as Kevin Daniel Stolth, 43, and Tanya Nichol Westoby, 44, were both known to the police and subsequently arrested. Stolth had outstanding warrants from Whitecourt, Fort Saskatchewan, and Stony Plain, while Westoby had warrants from Stony Plain and Edmonton. Stolth faces additional charges of possessing illegally obtained property valued over $5,000 and failure to comply with release conditions, while Westoby faces charges of possessing illegally obtained property over $5,000 and breaching probation. Stolth is currently in custody and scheduled to appear in the Alberta Court of Justice in Stony Plain on February 5, while Westoby has been released and is set to appear in court on February 21.
