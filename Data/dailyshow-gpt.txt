Jon Stewart will continue as a part-time host on Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" throughout the 2024 election cycle, with other hosts rotating during the rest of the week. He will also serve as executive producer for every episode until 2025. Stewart was assigned the Monday slot due to it being the most-watched day for the show and a day for catching up on weekend news. Paramount Media Networks' president and CEO, Chris McCarthy, praised Stewart's return, calling him "the voice of our generation" and highlighting his ability to provide clarity amidst societal division with his wit. Stewart previously hosted the show from 1999 to 2015, earning 24 Emmys and launching the careers of comedians like Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and Samantha Bee. Since leaving, Stewart pursued other ventures, including a talk show on Apple TV Plus, and has been active in advocating for the 9/11 victims fund. Trevor Noah, who replaced Stewart, left in December 2022, and Comedy Central has been experimenting with guest hosts like Charlamagne tha God, Sarah Silverman, Leslie Jones, and Michelle Wolf. Hasan Minhaj was considered a frontrunner but faced setbacks due to reports on embellished personal stories. The network plans to announce a permanent host in 2024. The late-night comedy landscape has evolved significantly since Stewart's tenure, with shows facing challenges in revenue, ratings, and competition from streaming and digital platforms.
