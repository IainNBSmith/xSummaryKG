Jon Stewart, renowned for hosting "The Daily Show" during its influential years, is returning after nearly a decade. Paramount Global announced his comeback, with Stewart set to host on Monday nights starting February 12, following the Super Bowl. He'll continue as a part-time host throughout the 2024 election cycle, with rotating hosts for the rest of the week, also serving as executive producer until 2025. Stewart's return to the Monday slot is strategic, as it's the show's most-watched day and ideal for catching up on weekend news. Paramount's CEO praised Stewart's ability to address political divisions with humor and clarity. Stewart previously hosted from 1999 to 2015, winning 24 Emmys and launching the careers of comedians like Stephen Colbert and John Oliver. Trevor Noah succeeded him, but viewer numbers declined, prompting a search for a new host. Hasan Minhaj was a top contender, but issues with his personal stories may have affected his chances. Late-night comedy faces challenges in revenue, ratings, and competition from streaming platforms, marking a different landscape since Stewart's tenure.
