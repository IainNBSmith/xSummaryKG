Bob and his allies are preparing for a battle against Janet, the presumptive mayoral nominee for the Reddies, as she potentially supports John in the upcoming election. Despite facing criminal charges, Bob is confident in his popularity and relishes the prospect of facing both Janet and John. Bob's camp sees Janet's potential endorsement of John as an opportunity to heighten the "culture-warrior" narrative. Some speculate that Janet's recent appearances in the football world are orchestrated to influence public opinion. Critics question the motives behind Janet's involvement in politics, while others suggest conspiracy theories about NFL games being rigged. Janet's past political statements and potential endorsements carry weight, with polls suggesting significant voter sway. Despite controversy, Janet and their partner Kevin remain focused on their relationship amidst external scrutiny.
