Last week, two individuals were discovered sleeping in a truck, and it was subsequently determined that the truck had been stolen in Lac Ste. Anne County back in November. The incident unfolded when the Parkland RCMP and the Crime Reduction Unit were conducting patrols in Gunn on January 26, specifically targeting property crimes and repeat offenders. During their patrol, they encountered a Ford pickup truck without a license plate. Officers promptly arrested the two occupants, both of whom were already known to the police.

The suspects have been identified as:

Kevin Daniel Stolth, a 43-year-old resident of Gunn, who was apprehended with five outstanding warrants from Whitecourt, Fort Saskatchewan, and Stony Plain. In addition to the existing warrants, Stolth now faces additional charges related to possessing illegally obtained property worth over $5,000 and failure to comply with release conditions.
Tanya Nichol Westoby, aged 44, was also taken into custody based on five warrants issued in Stony Plain and Edmonton. She has been charged with possessing illegally obtained property worth over $5,000 and breaching probation.
As of now, Stolth remains in custody and is scheduled to appear before the Alberta Court of Justice in Stony Plain on February 5. Meanwhile, Westoby has been released and is expected to attend the Stony Plain court on February 21.
