Two individuals were discovered sleeping in a truck last week, leading to charges being filed against them after it was revealed that the truck had been reported stolen in Lac Ste. Anne County back in November, as stated by the police. The Parkland RCMP and the Crime Reduction Unit were conducting patrols in Gunn on January 26, focusing on property crimes and repeat offenders, according to RCMP reports. During their patrol, they encountered a Ford pickup truck without a license plate. The officers proceeded to arrest the two occupants, both of whom were familiar to law enforcement.

Kevin Daniel Stolth, aged 43 and from Gunn, was apprehended with five outstanding warrants from Whitecourt, Fort Saskatchewan, and Stony Plain, according to police sources. In addition to these warrants, Stolth now faces additional charges of possessing illegally obtained property valued over $5,000 and failing to comply with release conditions.

Tanya Nichol Westoby, aged 44, was also taken into custody for five warrants from Stony Plain and Edmonton. She has been charged with possessing illegally obtained property valued over $5,000 and breaching probation.

Stolth is currently in custody and is slated to appear before the Alberta Court of Justice in Stony Plain on February 5. On the other hand, Westoby has been released and is scheduled to appear in the Stony Plain court on February 21.
