Young hockey players (aged 10-16) participated in a 72-hour marathon game to raise money for pediatric cancer research. The event, held at Saiker's Acres, benefitted the Cure Cancer Foundation and University of Alberta clinical trials. Over 45 players participated, scoring a combined 2,299 goals and raising over $400,000. Many players were personally motivated by the cause, with some having family members impacted by cancer. This year's event continued the tradition started in 2003, bringing the total funds raised to over $7.4 million for cancer research. The organizers are already planning the next events, including a baseball marathon in September and the adult hockey marathon returning in February 2025.
