Donald Trump is reportedly preparing for a political battle with Taylor Swift in anticipation of the upcoming election against Joe Biden. Trump’s team is readying for a “holy war” if Swift endorses the Democrats. Trump believes his popularity surpasses Swift’s and is not concerned about a potential endorsement from her for Biden. Trump’s campaign sees Swift’s potential support for Biden as an opportunity to intensify their “culture war”. Insiders close to Trump have warned Swift to stay out of the 2024 election. Speculation has arisen that Swift’s involvement in the football world, through her boyfriend Travis Kelce, is a government plot to sway voters towards Biden. Some even suggest that Swift might publicly endorse Biden during the Super Bowl halftime show. Swift, who previously stayed quiet on political issues, broke her silence in 2018 by voting for two Tennessee Democrats and has been critical of Trump. Despite not yet endorsing Biden’s reelection bid, her name is reportedly at the top of the list for potential high-profile supporters. A recent poll suggests that up to 18% of voters could be influenced by a Swift endorsement. Swift’s relationship with Kelce has reportedly created a “brand value” of $331.5 million US for the Chiefs and the NFL. Despite the political speculation surrounding their relationship, Kelce stated that they are simply enjoying their relationship and ignoring the “outside noise”.
