Some even suggest involvement of government or other powers to manipulate public perception.

Personal Dynamics: The relationship between Janet and Kevin is under scrutiny, with some suggesting it might distract from the political landscape. However, Kevin emphasizes their focus on each other and dismisses external noise.

Media Attention: Janet's influence extends beyond politics, with significant media coverage of their relationship and potential endorsements. There's also discussion about the impact of Janet's presence on NFL games and their brand value.

Public Perception: While Bob and Janet have had interactions in the past, including disagreements over political views, their current stances and potential endorsements are under close observation. Janet's past statements against Bob and promises to vote him out add intrigue to the situation.

Overall, the upcoming mayoral election seems to be shaping up as a mix of political maneuvering, celebrity influence, and media speculation, with various players vying for attention and support.
