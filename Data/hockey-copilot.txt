Saiker’s Acres hosted the World’s Longest Hockey Game Juniors from January 25 to 28, raising funds for pediatric clinical trials through the University of Alberta. The event, organized by Brent Saik, involved 45 youth players aged 10 to 16. Oilers alumni Craig MacTavish and Kevin Lowe participated in the ceremonial puck drop. Players like Xavier Wujcik and Kane Reimer contributed significantly to the game, scoring 140 and 149 goals respectively. The event raised over $400,000, with all funds going towards cancer research. Since 2003, the World’s Longest Hockey Game events at Saiker’s Acres have raised more than $7.4 million for cancer research. The venue is set to host the World’s Longest Baseball Game in September, and the adult version of the World’s Longest Hockey Game will return in February 2025.
