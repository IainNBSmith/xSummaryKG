It sounds like the World's Longest Hockey Game Juniors at Saiker's Acres was a great success! The event, which ran from January 25 to January 28, was organized by Brent Saik and supported the Cure Cancer Foundation. The funds raised will go towards supporting pediatric clinical trials at the University of Alberta.

The game involved 45 youth players aged between 10 and 16. Oilers alumni Craig MacTavish and Kevin Lowe were present for the ceremonial puck drop. Xavier Wujcik, a forward with the Sherwood Park Athletics' U13 AA Jets, played seven three-hour shifts and scored 140 goals. 

Other notable participants included Landon Ternovatsky and Kane Reimer, both from Sherwood Park. Ternovatsky was inspired by Ben Stelter's story and was happy to raise money for cancer research. Reimer, who plays with SP504 in Tier 1, contributed 149 goals across eight three-hour shifts.

By the end of the event, 2,299 goals were scored and over $400,000 was raised. This is a testament to what children can achieve when they come together for a cause. Since 2003, the World's Longest Hockey Game hosted at Saiker's Acres has raised more than $7.4 million in support of leading-edge equipment and cancer research.

Preparations are already underway for Saiker's Acres to host the World's Longest Baseball Game in September, and the adult version of the World's Longest Hockey Game is set to return in February 2025. It's clear that the spirit of community and the drive to support cancer research remains strong in these events.
