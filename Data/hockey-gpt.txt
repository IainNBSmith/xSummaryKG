Saiker’s Acres recently hosted the World’s Longest Hockey Game Juniors in support of the Cure Cancer Foundation, spanning from January 25th to 28th. The event aimed to raise funds for pediatric clinical trials through the University of Alberta. With Oilers alumni present for the ceremonial puck drop, 45 youth players aged 10 to 16 participated in the game. Xavier Wujcik and Kane Reimer were notable contributors, scoring numerous goals despite grueling shifts. The event raised over $400,000 and scored 2,299 goals by its conclusion. This year's event continued the tradition of community unity against cancer, with preparations already underway for future events supporting cancer research. Since its inception in 2003, the World’s Longest Hockey Game has raised over $7.4 million.
