Jon Stewart is returning to The Daily Show as a part-time host for the 2024 US election cycle. He'll take over Monday nights starting February 12th, with the rest of the week featuring rotating hosts. Stewart will also be the show's executive producer through 2025. This is a big deal because Stewart was the show's host during its peak popularity, turning it into a cultural phenomenon that launched the careers of other comedians. The network hopes his return will boost ratings and provide insightful commentary during a heated election year. It's worth noting that late-night shows are facing challenges overall, with lower viewership and competition from streaming services.
